This is an example project that shows how to change the `processInstanceId` of process instances in the byte-arrays of the jBPM database.

**DISCLAIMER: This was the output of a coding challenge to see if this can be technically done. This code should NOT be used on production data as it can corrupt your database. I can not, and will not, provide any support on this code, nor will I fix any issue that you encounter in this code.**

Also, this code is not complete. It only allows to alter the `processInstanceId` in 2 places, in the `ProcessInstance` and the `WorkItem` instance. The id is however stored in multiple places, so this code currently only works for simple use-cases.

This project targets a Oracle 19c database.

Requires Red Hat GA repo's to bet set up. Doing this in maven settings.xml. 

Also requires KJAR that contains the process definition of the process instance you are trying to change. See pom.xml.
